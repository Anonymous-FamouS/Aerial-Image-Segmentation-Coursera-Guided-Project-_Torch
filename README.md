## üß† Project Overview

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with **semantic image segmentation** using aerial imagery. A deep learning model was trained to extract and segment **road networks** from high-resolution aerial images.

- Framework used: **PyTorch**
- Model architecture: **U-Net**
- Encoder: **EfficientNet** (pretrained on ImageNet)
- Task: Segmenting roads from aerial photographs

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a subset of the **Massachusetts Roads Dataset**, consisting of:

- **200 aerial images** (with corresponding ground-truth masks)
- Image dimensions: `1500 √ó 1500` pixels
- Coverage: Each image spans approximately **2.25 km¬≤**

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries & Their Usage

| Library                            | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `torch`                            | Deep learning framework used for model definition, training, and inference. |
| `segmentation_models_pytorch`      | Provides the U-Net model architecture with pretrained EfficientNet encoder. |
| `albumentations`                   | Used for image augmentation (resize, flips) in training and validation data. |
| `opencv-python (cv2)`              | For reading, converting, and processing input images and masks.        |
| `numpy`                            | Array operations and pre-processing (e.g., expanding mask dimensions). |
| `pandas`                           | Reading and handling CSV dataset file.                                 |
| `matplotlib.pyplot`                | Visualising input images, masks, and model predictions.                |
| `scikit-learn (train_test_split)` | Splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets.            |
| `tqdm`                             | Adding progress bars during model training.                            |
| `helper` *(custom module)*         | Contains project-specific utility functions like training loop, evaluation, plotting, and loss functions. |
| `torch.utils.data.Dataset`         | Used to create a custom dataset class for loading and augmenting image-mask pairs. |
